I originally created this project to work on the problems of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).

As a joke, I named the project **project-gauss** in tribute to the other great mathematician.

Given that the authors of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) ask not to share the solutions
publicly, I decided to respect that request and not to submit them.

However, this project contains some of the functions/utilities developed to solve the challenges.

Additionally, over time I have added stuff unrelated to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) like coding challenges.
